# • Simulated P-N junction diodes with various configurations such as doping, length, and junction profiles. Analyzed I-V characteristics, capacitance behavior, and switching speeds. Developed a MATLAB function to calculate breakdown voltage and compared different configurations
# • Designed and simulated MOS capacitors with aluminum and poly-silicon gates. Analyzed threshold voltage, capacitance behavior, and band structures under different bias conditions. Conducted sensitivity analysis on doping, temperature, and oxide thickness.
